# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel very confident with comparison operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel fairly confident here. I once took a class on logic and some of the terms are familiar to me.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Pretty good, although I need to remember to include the end after the if statements.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Over an hour of just working but practically half the day of trouble shooting. That did not line up with my time estimate at all but now I know where I went wrong and can be quicker next time. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Technically speaking I really need to get more fluent with cloning and pushing on Git. In terms of the arrays lesson though, I feel pretty good.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have utilized the slack channel quite a bit today and got all my answers.
